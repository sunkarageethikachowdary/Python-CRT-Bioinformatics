data astructures:
        built in data structurs - list,dict, tuple, set
        user defined - stack,queue,tree,graph, linked list,graph,hashmap

linked list 

singly linked list:
                    generally linked list means a singly linked list. each containss only one link which points to the subsequent nodes in the list
DOubly linked list:
                    it'a a two way linked list as each node points not only to the next pointer but also to the [previous pointer
Circular linked list: 
                    There is no tail node i.e,. the next feild is never none and the next feild for the last node points to the head node
circular doubly linked list: 
                    combination of both doubly linked list and circular linked list.                    

traversing the linked list
                    follow the pointers
                    display the concept of nodes for count as they are traversed
                    stop when the next pointer is none
printing the linked list:
                    

insertion of a node in a singly linked list:
                    3 possible cases
                    inserting a new node before the head (at the beginning)
                    inserting a new node after the tail (at the end of the list)
                    inserting a new node in the middle of the list(randim location)
                    
deletion of a node in linked list:
                    deleting the first node
                    deleting the last node
                    deleting an intermediate node
